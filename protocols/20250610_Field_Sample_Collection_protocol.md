##Snail Sample Collections 2025 
-

 
### Materials 
- Forceps 
- Teeny collection jars 
- Snail jars with holes 
- Orange buckets 
- Temperature Loggers 
- Drills 
- Rock Drills 
- Drill bits, drywall anchors, screws 
- Paint scraper 
- Gloves 
- Scissors 
- Field workwear 
- Sharpies 
 
### Protocol
 
1) Fill out emergency contact info sheet and field safety plans sheet on the one drive in the “Field Safety” folder 

2)Select sites with large clutches of Nucella  
In the case of summer 2025: 

- Bass Rock 
- Ram Island 
- Castle Rock 


3) Identify different batches of egg capsules 

- Nucella are direct developers, so they only need to be at least 2 meters apart 
- For summer 2025, collect from 6 batches per site with 8 egg capsules from each batch 

4) Collect egg capsules 

- Egg capsules that are collected need to be a creamy yellowish color 
- Pull off at the base 
- Make sure site code is written on a label on the jar

5) At the batch where egg capsules were collected 6 quadrats will be placed around sampled batches 
 
- Place the batch in the middle of the quadrat 
- Record total # egg capsule, # laying adults, #other Nucella, % cover barnacles, % cover Mussels, % cover Asco, % Fucus, % cover other, #Carcinus, # Hemi 


6) Deploy temperature loggers at each site 

- Set up hobo loggers prior to anchoring them with them labelled with each site name 
- Using paint scraper and gloves clear a flat area  
- Make sure it is not in a crevasse, no shadows- just flat open rock 
- Make sure there is no algae that would wash over the logger when the tide rises, trim it with the scissors 
- Make a template for the hobo loggers and mark on the rocks 
- Drill holes with the rock drill 
- Place a drywall anchor in each hole 
- Screw the hobo logger into the anchors 
- Attach 2 temp loggers along tide height where Nucella are found 


7) Collect food snails for experimental crabs 

- In the summer 2025 experiment, crabs are being used for stress cues and will eat Nucella once in the mesocosm  
- Collect 500 Nucella to feed ~32 crabs 2 a week for 4-6 weeks 
- They should be under 2 cm more like 1.5cm and thin lipped 
- Try to collect them in multiple locations, castle rock and somewhere else  
- Put them in the holy snail containers 
- They don’t need to be submerged in water maybe some seaweed on top to keep them moist 
- They can be compacted in containers in the field and then spread out in the lab, keep them in the snail containers with holes and then put them in a larger tank
