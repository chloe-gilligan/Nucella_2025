## Field Transect Surveys

 
### Materials: 
- 2 quadrats 
- Transect 
- Plastic clipboards 
- Write in the rain paper 
- Field workwear 

### Protocol: 
 
1) Surveys will occur at the sites where snails were collected 

2) Quadrats and transects will occur at 1 single tide height where egg capsules are located

3) Lay a 30m transect parallel to the water

4) Along the transect place 5-6 quadrats haphazardly by running a random # generator 0-30 and then pick #â€™s evenishly distributed 

5)  Record total # egg capsule, # laying adults, #other Nucella, % cover barnacles, % cover Mussels, % cover Asco, % Fucus, % cover other, #Carcinus, # Hemi 

6) Run 1 transect per site 

- But could do second if it seems that mussels are at a different tide height than Nucella
