## Measurements - Newly Emerged offspring 2025

 
### Materials: 


* Petri dish 
* NIS-Elements D 6.10.01 
* Filter of snails 
* Froceps

 
### Protocol: 

#### Computer SETUP 

1. Log in with individual SSO 
2. Turn on microscope power button 
3. Select the “NIS Elements” desktop icon. “NIS Elements Analysis” is not connected to the microscope 
4. If prompted with a Setup and Configuration window, select “Select automatically on startup” checkbox and “Fi3” in dropdown- Most likely only the first time you set up 
5. Access camera by pushing knob on right side (removes function of right eyepiece) 
6. Leave on 0.63 
7. Leave on photo 
8. Switch the fiber optic  
9. Magnification is auto-calibrated 
10. Make sure the magnification on the scope matches the magnification on the computer. Failing to do so will result in inaccurate measurements 
1. If the image appears too white you can select auto white balance 
1. Zoom knobs have stops at full numbers (full numbers are best for taking measurements) 

#### Taking a photo 

1. Click “Play” or “Live” (These do the same thing) 
2. Click "Capture" 
3. Select "Acquisition" to open images 
4. Photos should be under the “Opened Images” tab 
5. “Frozen” refers to the live view/ photo 

#### Taking composite images/ EDF 

1. Start with something in focus, then click the EDF (Extended Depth of Field) butterfly 
	- This selects the pixel most in focus 
2. Align images checked and click “start” 
3. Slowly scroll until everything is in focus and click “finish” 
4. Options available by clicking first toolbar up from photo, rainbow icon is EDF settings 
5. Don’t need to click capture, it’s just live view 
6. Save as .nd file to re-edit in software later 

#### Taking Manual large Images(Manual LI) 

1. Stitch photos manually 
2. Red is no good 
3. Magenta means the pic is being taken 

#### Taking Measurements

1. Select “Annotations and Measurements” (A&M) tab 
2. Choose measuring tool and click on object to measure. Measurement is automatically recorded in table 
3. Tools can use multipoint length measurement if subject is curved 
4. To adjust units, go to the bottom left of the screen and right click on Calibration # to adjust units or numbers of degrees 
5. To get back to live you can hit between freeze and live 
6. Try to measure in live 
7. Try not to change the objective if so, make sure it is consistent between objective and computer 

#### Making Annotations 

1. Click vertical bar icon under Annotations section of A&M tab for scale bar 
2. The scale bar is moveable 
3. Adjust color, font options, and burn the scale bar by right-clicking to open scale bar properties 
4. Burning the scale bar will permanently add it and delete any pixels once beneath. This cannot be undone 
5. Multipoint icon allows you to choose the endpoints of your measurement 
6. This allows for multiple measurements in one image if you reselect the Multipoint icon each time to start a new measurement 
7. Clicking “Burn Annotations” will permanently add annotations and delete any pixels beneath. This cannot be undone 
8. To hide annotations, click last icon under Annotations section of A&M tab 
9. Delete individual annotations by right-clicking and selecting “Delete” 
10. Delete ALL annotations by right-clicking on “Display/Don’t Display” button in toolbar 

#### Adding scale bar 

1. Blue A top right under acquisition 
2. On vertical tool bar, select burn scale, right click  
3. Save in RDS 

#### Miscellaneous tips and tricks

1. To go live after an image, select Capture and store on acquisition tab 
2. Remember that there is both physical AND digital zoom 
3. White Balance can be reset by clicking on a spot that should be white and clicking the Auto White button 
4. If capture is hidden, right-click on black desktop on left side and select “Display” 
5. Exposure can by fine-tuned with slide bar 
6. Auto exposure will tell you the value that gets the best range 
7. Camera not meant for fluorescence, but can be configured 
8. High quality is good for capture, high focus is good for live 
9. If computer repeatedly goes to sleep, the camera may disconnect. Just re-open the software 
10. Should not need to recalibrate the microscope unless hardware physically changes 
11. Click “Calibrate” 
12. Lylah saved settings on the computer and would be able to restore to initial setup parameters if need be 

#### Measuring for summer 2025 

1.  Once and egg capsule emerges, select 10 snails from each filter to measure
2.  Collect 10 snails per tea infuser 
3.  Line up 10 snails and take a photo
4.  Using the line, measure the longest length and width of all 10 snails.
5.  In the comments, provide the sample ID, snail# 1-10, and a L (length) or W (width)
6.  Write down measurements on physical data sheets
7.  AND export spreadsheet of measurements throught hte Nikon app to csv 
8.  Save measurements to excel/ one drive account 



#### Shutting down the computer and microscope

1.  Save photos to edit N2D file 
2.  Save with annotations 
3.  JPEGS won’t allow edits 
4.  You can bulk save 
5.  Save in RDS 
6.  Turn down light to 0 
7.  Switch fiber optic attachment back to gooseneck 
8.  Put tarp over
