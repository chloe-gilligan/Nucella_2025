## Ash Free Dry Weight - Newly Emerged offspring 2025

 
### Materials: 

- Drying Oven (60°C) 
- Muffle furnace (450°C) 
- Aluminum micro weigh boats 
- Analytical balance (0.0001 g) 


#### Goal: Determine shell (inorganic content) and tissue (organic content) weights
  
 
### Protocol: 


1) From each tea infuser, collect 2 snails 

2) Measure individual snail length and width at emergence on microscope 

3) Freeze snails individually at -20ºC with measurements recorded in spreadsheet 

4) When ready, thaw snails and rinse 5 times with deionized water 

5) Dry snails in drying oven (60ºC) for 5 days 

6) Pre-burn aluminum pans  

7) Weigh pre-burned aluminum pans and record 
 
8) Line up empty pre-burned micro weigh boats in numerical order using tweezers onto small metal weber grill drip trays. 

9) Weigh snails individually in weigh boats on microbalance and record, making sure to record which snail is in which weigh boat (column on spreadsheet)
 
10) Next, ash snails in the muffle furnace in their tins at 450ºC for 4 hours  

11) Let snails come back to room temperature and weigh again and record 

12) Calculate tissue mass (mg) by subtracting mass after ashing from initial mass 

13) Calculate shell mass (mg) by subtracting mass after ashing from the mass of the weighing tin alone
